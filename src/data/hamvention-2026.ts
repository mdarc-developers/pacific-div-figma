      "Whether you are operating portable or permanent, you will find the convenience of a dual-band Log Periodic antenna to be an incredibly convenient and powerful tool in your communication operations. Having both 2 Meter and 70 cm Bands in a compact, two foot long package, without having to bother with a duplexer is just a real lifesaver to most operating environments. From bouncing signals off of satellites, to working simplex two or three counties aways – you cannot go wrong with the Elk 2M/440L5! All Elk 2M/440L5 models come with a handle for handheld operation, making this antenna perfectly set up for satellite, DFing, EmComm, and very portable operation.  The feed on all Elk Antennas is from the front of the antenna.  The end where you connect the feedline is where you point the antenna. By the way, this is an excellent antenna for GMRS and MURS operation!",

From the mid-1940s to the 80s, Collins was a dominant force in the entire radio communications field. Collins radios were everywhere, from commercial radio stations to Strategic Air Command bombers, to Navy carriers and submarines and the NASA Apollo/Gemini programs, both earth and space”. Why was Collins so dominant? In this presentation we will cover the key technological innovations that allowed Collins to displace major competitors- RCA, Magnavox and others. Amazingly enough, some of those innovations are still present in modern communication equipment.",
